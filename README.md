# data-structures-and-algorithm-in-python
The following project contains the solutions for the free udacity course 'Data structures &amp; algorithms in python', you can access via the following link:

## Why am I doing this?

Almost 10 years ago I studed my first 'Data Structures' course in Java, during my Computer Science studies. Lately, I've been reviewing my knowledge in CS and since I'm learning Python, I thought that this would be the perfect course for me.
I decided to organize all the content and code that I collected and give it back to the community and to myself to use it as a reference in the future :)

## How is the information structured?

Since the course itself is divided in several modules, I decided to assign each module to one folder.
In each folder you will find all the different python scripts numbered as '1nameExecise.py'. All the scripts are working and giving the desired results for the day 19/07/2022. 
Also, the solutions to the questionaries are saved as .txt files. You may find them as 'QX-examplePractice'.

## References

Not all of the code that is found within this project is mine. Some of the resources were taken from the internet. I think that most of it it's referenced in the comments of the scripts, although there are some scripts (specially in the trees/graphs sections) that were not referenced since they were mostly taken from the following links:

I recommend to take a look at the previous links, since they contain lot of useful material for Computer Science and Software Engineering in general.
