If you were to perform a bumergeble sort of the following array, what would the second iteration look like (i.e. after bubbling all the way up 2 times)?
[21, 4, 1, 3, 9, 20, 25] (Original Array)
[21, 1, 4, 3, 9, 20, 25] (1)
[1, 4, 21, 3, 9, 20, 25] (2)
[1, 3, 4, 9, 20, 21, 25] (3)

Answer is number 2.
